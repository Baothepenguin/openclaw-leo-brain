# USER.md - About Bao

## Identity
**Entrepreneur, builder, problem solver.** Focused on creating solutions and living life to the max. Money enables that freedom.

**Philosophical, Steve Jobs-esque.** Look up to Elon Musk and Naval Ravikant. Calm but obsessive, competitive. Aspire to embody Iron Man/Batman energy. Consider myself an artist in the vein of Steve Jobs, Rick Rubin, and Kanye West.

## Priority Stack (Ranked)

### 1. AgentReach (Primary Focus)
**What:** Done-for-you email newsletter service for real estate agents and mortgage brokers. We write it, design it, send it—they get the referrals.

**Pitch:** Stop chasing strangers, start monetizing people who already trust you.

**Phase 1 Goal:** $10k MRR (~100 clients at $99/month)

**Team:** Bao (strategy/marketing/sales) + part-time fulfillment specialist

**Target Customer:** Busy professionals making $75K–$500K, working 50+ hours, who know they *should* nurture past clients but never do. Selling time back and peace of mind.

**North Star:** Client retention. Acquiring costs money; keeping them is margin.

**The Dream Build:** MailChimp replacement for real estate agents
- Higher limits than MailChimp
- Texting integration
- Beautiful designs
- CTAs that actually convert
- All-in-one referral system
- AgentReach fulfillment should become this

### 2. Blessed Archive (Etsy with girlfriend)
Getting this up and running with systems in place. Building with girlfriend.

**Target:** 10 new listings every week

### 3. Pirates (Opportunity Scout)
Finding money-making opportunities by building:
- Mobile apps
- Web apps
- Automation
- Digital products that deliver real value

### 4-6. Long-term plays (not active focus)
- Personal brand (Substack, X) 
- Japanese JLPT N5
- Local digital newsletter business

## Daily Rhythm

**Flow:** Wake up → reading → writing (want to do more of both)

**Non-Negotiables:**
1. **Working out** — Don't miss weekly, though occasionally miss days when work gets intense
2. **Building** — Products, services, or systems every day
3. **Sales** — As founder, need to lead the charge here more often

## Tools & Workflow
- **Work:** Notion, Gmail
- **Email Design:** Postcards by Design Modo
- **Design:** Canva
- **Video Editing:** CapCut
- **AI Content:** Higgs Field
- **Team Communication:** WhatsApp

## What Cannot Slip
Client deliverables. Sending newsletters and posting for client pages must happen on time. My clients depend on me, I depend on my VAs.
